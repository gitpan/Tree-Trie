README for Tree::Trie

			    Tree::Trie

Tree::Trie is an implementation of a Trie data structure in Perl.

PREREQUISITES

This suite requires Perl 5; I've only used it under Perl 5.10.0, so for
anything lower, you're on your own.

Tree::Trie doesn't use any nonstandard modules.  In fact, it doesn't use
any modules at all.

INSTALLATION

You install Tree::Trie, as you would install any perl module
library, by running these commands:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

If you want to install a private copy of Tree::Trie in your home
directory, then you should try to produce the initial Makefile with
something like this command:

  perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=~/perl

DOCUMENTATION

POD-format documentation is included in Trie.pm.  POD is readable
with the 'perldoc' utility.

SUPPORT

Questions, bug reports, useful code bits, and suggestions for
Tree::Trie should just be sent to me at avi@finkel.org

AVAILABILITY

The latest version of Tree::Trie is available from the
Comprehensive Perl Archive Network (CPAN).  Visit
